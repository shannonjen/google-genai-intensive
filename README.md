# 🚀 Google Generative AI 5-Day Intensive

Welcome to my notes, reflections, and experiments from the [Google GenAI 5-Day Intensive Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-genai) offered via Kaggle. This repository complements my hands-on work in Kaggle notebooks and serves as a space to document key insights and track progress.

## 📌 About This Repository

As a technical enablement leader exploring GenAI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AI-powered learning systems, I'm using this course to:

- Deepen my understanding of foundational GenAI concepts
- Practice implementing real-world GenAI tools and workflows
- Reflect on how these tools apply to technical onboarding, knowledge delivery, and learning strategy

This is a **"learning in public"** space. Expect raw notes, questions, and iterative improvements.

## 💡 Why This Matters

This course supports my broader 10-week [**Embedded Intelligence**](https://github.com/shannonjen/embedded-intelligence) project, where I’m building an AI-powered RAG system for technical knowledge navigation. The learnings here feed directly into that larger exploration.
